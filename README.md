·           What is the function of the tool?
The function of the tool is to provide a sentimental score for each singer (probably the most popular 50 singers) based on sentimental analysis of their songs’ lyrics. The users can also search singer names by providing their current emotion.
·           Who will benefit from such a tool?
The tool is very general. Anyone would be able to see the “sentiment score” of their favorite singers, and to discover new singers based on their emotion. This would be interesting to most people listening to music.
·           Does this kind of tools already exist? If similar tools exist, how is your tool different from them? Would people care about the difference?
To our knowledge (we haven’t performed any thorough literature review due to time constraint), there is no such tool available online for English language singers. Thought we found a similar study in a Chinese website.
·           What existing resources can you use?
We are planning to conduct our study based on existing web crawlers, sentiment analysis tool. We will also modify the existing resources to optimize for our own purpose.
·           What techniques/algorithms will you use to develop the tool? (It's fine if you just mention some vague idea.)
The techniques we’re planning to use are:
1.     Build a web crawler based on existing ones to get singer/lyrics data from the web.
2.     Develop a lyrics sentiment analysis tool to get the sentiment score of each song, and then each singer.
3.     Build a server side databased and a web interface, where user can browse the singers based on each “sentiment score”, and searching singers based on their current emotion.
·           How will you demonstrate the usefulness of your tool.
A web-based demo page will be created. It should have the following functions:
1.     The users can browse the singers based on “sentiment score”, such as “very sad”, “no emotion”, “happy”, etc.
2.     The users can search singers by providing their desired “sentiment scores”.
3.     The users can click into any song, and see the sentiment analysis result of certain sentences in the lyric.
